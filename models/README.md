# Models

There are two models in this dir:

- breakout-holder: This is a holder for the temperature/humidity sensors
- pololu-accelerometer-case.stl: A fully encasing plastic shell for a Pololu accelerometer, which is compatibel with the Adafruit one.

If someone need an accelerometer pill-type case for an Adafruit sensor, I'd be happy to make one. Shout!
